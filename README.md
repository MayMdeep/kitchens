# kitchens
a test for Coders District "Kitchen Management Module This technical test focuses on creating a kitchen management system that allows users to manage their  kitchen, oversee related users, locations, sub-locations, and products. The application will be a part of a  restaurant dashboard, supporting multiple restaurants, each with its own kitchen."


please note the user_id in StoreProductTransactionAction has to be auth('sanctum')->user()->id; instead of $data['user_id']=1; I've noticed it so i write it here not to push any commits after deadline
